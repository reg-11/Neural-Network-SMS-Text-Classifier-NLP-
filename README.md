# Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier-(Deep Learning)
Spam Detection: Text classification using Dense network in TensorFlow2

## Getting Started
This project uses Google Colaboratory which is a cloud-hosted version of Jupyter Notebook. 
This is a document containing both text cells for documentation and runnable code cells. 

## Running Web Application
Run all the cells under the new section to run the web application:
This includes installing streamlit and ngrok, writing the main application, and establishing connection.

## Tools
  - TensorFlow2 
  - Streamlit
  - ngrok
  - Keras
  - Sklearn
  - numpy
  - pandas
